This task generates an identifier that can be used to uniquely identify a build.

The build identifier that is generated is a composite of the short commit
hash from the source code repository plus a UUID generated by [ksuid](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid). The benefit of ksuid is that it generates date sortable UUIDs that can be reversed into a date representation.

The identifier that is generated is formatted as `<short-commit-hash>-<ksuid-uuid>`.

The following command can be used to reverse the ksuid UUID back to a date/time stamp:

```
ksuid -f inspect <uuid>
```
